            I have <strong>~2 years of commercial experience</strong> where I've had the opportunity to work on both internal and user-facing features.<br /><br />
            
            The ability to write code that solves problems and provides great experiences for end users is something I continue to enjoy as I
            develop in this career; and is a driving motivation for staying up-to-date with the latest frameworks, libraries and best practices.<br /><br />
            
            As a former <strong>QA Engineer</strong>, I have both an interest and appreciation for good <strong>user experience</strong> - which helps me to always keep quality in the forefront when working on projects.

            <br /><br />Technologies I've used along the way include: <strong>JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React, Redux, Apollo GraphQL, JEST</strong>.
